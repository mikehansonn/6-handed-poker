------
TO FIX
------

- If human players are all in (they have 0 chips) just progress the game don't let them call an action
- If HumanUser loses send them back to the home page


- Side pots printing is messed up on the frontend
- Don't show other players hands on the frontend 
- Add in end game button that returns you to the homepage and deletes your game_id  

-----
STEPS:
-----


1. Update frontend for game setup pages 


2. Add In table talk from bots
    - I think I need to cause a whole delay on the game before I progress after the comment
3. Add in AI coach

------------
RUNNING CODE
------------

- Run backend server: uvicorn main:app --reload which listen on http://127.0.0.1:8000

- Run frontend with npm install, npm start which runs on  http://localhost:3000.





- 
-------------------------------------

- The problem is start_hand is called after the AI_coach somehow, either we have to make sure it is called after
  or define all of the necesary variables in the init function for TexasHoldem class
