TO FIX
------

Pots still going to the wrong person sometimes
Sometimes, a player will fold, and it will progress a card without giving everyone a chance to move
Showdown is not flipping cards when the bot was the last to act on the river 

-----
STEPS:
-----


1. Update frontend for game setup pages 


2. Add In table talk from bots
    - I think I need to cause a whole delay on the game before I progress after the comment
3. Add in AI coach

------------
RUNNING CODE
------------

- Run backend server: uvicorn main:app --reload which listen on http://127.0.0.1:8000

- Run frontend with npm install, npm start which runs on  http://localhost:3000.





- 
-------------------------------------

- The problem is start_hand is called after the AI_coach somehow, either we have to make sure it is called after
  or define all of the necesary variables in the init function for TexasHoldem class
