POKER BOT

Plan:

STEPS:
-----

1. Buy OpenAI credit and use my own key 
2. test 6 any size game
3. Add Basic frontend based off chatgpt description 


----------------------------
BACKEND FRONTEND INTERACTION
----------------------------

1. Backend waits while user selects number of bots, and bots' personalities
2. REQUEST #1: User clicks CREATE GAME, @router.post("/games/create") is called to set up the game and spin up a new game session
    - RESPONSE #1: JSON formatted data with the GameID and Game State. Basic data is returned in the game state, through get_create_game_json()
3. Backend is now waiting for the user to click START GAME, with the new game in the dictionary 
4. REQUEST #2: User clicks START GAME, this is essencially just starting a new hand, since everything is already initialized, this is the same request that has to be called each time we start a new hand
    - RESPONSE #2: Not completely sure yet 


------------
RUNNING CODE
------------

- Run frontend server: uvicorn app:app --reload which listen on http://127.0.0.1:8000

- Run backend with npm install, npm start which runs on  http://localhost:3000.

FOR MIKE
--------
- To see how it works run the above commands to start both of the servers (GOT TO RUN THEM IN DIFFERENT TERMINALS)
- Then proceed through the React app and when you press Create Game after you pick your players you will see the data in the console.logs
